## Release Notes

### v1.10.0 Highlights

This major release focuses on **professional-grade file management** and **robust process control**, making EZ-PHASE suitable for production bioinformatics workflows. The enhanced status tracking system provides clear visibility into batch processing operations, while the improved process control ensures reliable execution even with large datasets.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Better Workflow Management**: Visual status tracking for all files
- **Improved Reliability**: Robust process control with proper cleanup  
- **Enhanced Performance**: Auto-detection and optimization features
- **Professional UI**: More intuitive and informative interface

### Breaking Changes
None. This release is fully backward compatible with existing workflows.

### Migration Guide
No migration steps required. Existing configurations and workflows will continue to work seamlessly.

### Known Issues
- Large datasets (>1000 individuals) may require manual memory management
- Some Windows antivirus software may flag the executable (false positive)
- macOS Gatekeeper may require manual approval for first launch

### Future Roadmap

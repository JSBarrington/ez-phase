## üîß Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- Git
- PHASE 2.1.1 binary (for testing)

### Setup Steps
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/JSBarrington/ez-phase.git
cd ez-phase

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Run tests (when available)
npm test
```

### Development Scripts
```bash
npm start          # Run the app in development mode
npm run build      # Build for production
npm run build-mac  # Build macOS DMG
npm run build-win  # Build Windows installer
npm test           # Run tests
npm run lint       # Run ESLint
```

## üìù Code Style

We use ESLint for code style. Please ensure your code follows these guidelines:

### JavaScript Style
- Use **ES6+** features where appropriate
- **2 spaces** for indentation
- **Single quotes** for strings
- **Semicolons** at the end of statements
- **camelCase** for variables and functions
- **PascalCase** for classes and components

### Example
```javascript
const handleFileSelection = async (filePaths) => {
  try {
    const validFiles = filePaths.filter(file => file.endsWith('.inp'));
    
    if (validFiles.length === 0) {
      throw new Error('No valid .inp files found');
    }
    
    return await processFiles(validFiles);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('File selection error:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

### HTML/CSS Style
- **2 spaces** for indentation
- **kebab-case** for CSS classes
- **Semantic HTML** elements where possible
- **CSS Grid/Flexbox** for layouts

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing
Before submitting a PR, please test:

1. **Installation**: Fresh `npm install` works
2. **Basic functionality**: App starts and loads correctly
3. **File selection**: Can select directories and .inp files
4. **PHASE execution**: Can run PHASE with sample data
5. **Cross-platform**: Test on your available platforms

### Automated Testing (Future)
We're planning to add:
- Unit tests with Jest
- Integration tests for PHASE execution
- E2E tests with Spectron

## üìã Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if needed
2. **Add tests** for new features (when testing framework is ready)
3. **Ensure CI passes** (when CI is set up)
4. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with your changes
5. **Request review** from maintainers
